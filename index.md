# <a id="_wcbyik9p97p8"></a>Welcome to the new CMS

This is your home page. You can edit it just like a regular document.

Cloudstitch will translate those edits into git commits with the associated repository. If you’re reading this because you’ve cloned the Jekyll Blog example on Cloudstitch, try changing this document, syncing your Cloudstitch project, and then viewing the git repository we created for you!
